# ojd-eviction-scraping-daily-PLUS

Use the instructions from the main scraper to set up the scraping environment.  There are several ways to run the daily scraper but the prefered method so far has been to run the filecalled scheduler.py

scheduler.py will continue to run in the background and will automatically run run_daily_script_plus.bat at the specified time each day.
